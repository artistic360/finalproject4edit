(10001)      \--------------------------------------------------------o

Leon Kennedy - The hero of the tale, this is Leon's second tale in the 
Resident Evil series, as he was one of the two main characters from Resident 
Evil 2.  Seperate from R.P.D. now Leon works for the government and he's be 
assigned to a special mission.  The president's daughter has been kidnapped 
and the perpetrator has eluded everyone.  Intellegence has tracked her mostly  
likely location to a small village in Europe where Leon is sent.  Everything 
seems rather routine at the beginning, however things quickly escalate into 
an encounter so intense, it rivals the one from six years ago...

Luis Sera - Luis Sera is a mysterious person who Leon first meets unexpectedly 
when searching for the president's daughter.  The man seems unwilling to 
reveal much about himself or what he's doing there, however the circumstances 
they find themselves in give the impression this man knows far more than he's 
willing to let on.

Ashley Graham - Ashley is the daughter of the president of the United States 
of America.  She is the reason Leon has been assigned to this mission in a 
far off town in the middle of Europe.  Finding Ashley will be an ordeal to 
say the least.  Even more elusive than who kidnapped her is why they 
kidnapped her, the signs point to much more than a simple ransom.

Bitores Mendez - Mendez is responsible to the majority of the written memos 
Leon finds throughout his mission.  Mendez himself is as mysterious as the 
circumstances however, it seems as though he is working for someone known as 
Lord Saddler, but how or why he got into this situation and what his true 
motives are cannot be obtained by any reasonable means.

Ramon Salazar - Ramon Salazar is the descendant of the Salazar family which 
has occupied the castle for many generations.  His immature behavior and 
small stature are not good indicators of his vile nature.  Salazar seems to 
have fallen victim to some outside influence, however who or what this 
influence is undetermined.  Leon can however expect to encounter him more 
than a few times.

The Rest - A woman in red, a violent knife fighter, a cloaked individual... 
they all play important roles in Leon's mission and his very survival (or 
death) through the story.  To avoid spoilers these people will have to remain 
as nameless as they are from the very start...

It's important to have the basic idea of how the gameplays down before 
actually getting in to it.  It's not too hard so just read closely.  There are 
a number of new game mechanics introduced in Resident Evil 4 from the camera 
angle, to the shops to the chapter system.  I'll try to outline everything as 
best I can and avoid spoilers doing it.

You've probably got the basic idea of moving around pretty well.  You can go 
up to things and interact with them by pressing the A button.  Some things can 
be interacted with in different ways like ladders, which you can push over and 
pick back up at will.  You've got control of your basic camera with the C-
stick, this will come in handy when trying to view an entire area.  You've 
also got a menu accessable by pressing Y, here you can equip different weapons 
and use healing items.  Each item you pick up takes up some space in your 
inventory.  As you go through the game it is possible to get bigger cases 
however it is quite small to start.  Use the X button to pick items up and R 
to rotate them, this way you can arrange your inventory to pick up everything 
you get.  If you happen to overflow put an item in the area on the right side 
and you can discard it.

Open your map by pressing the Z button, many things are displayed here and it 
will be essential when using the walkthrough to know the different between 
East and West when your camera is comstantly moving around.  You have two 
different kinds of weapons, short range and long range.  Short range is 
limited to the knife in your inventory, equip it by holding L and you can 
slash things like the many crates and barrels you will find.  Long range 
pretty much applies to every other weapon in the game.  Hold R to bring up 
your gun, each gun is equipped with a laser sight which acts as your 
crosshairs.  Point at at something and press A to fire.  

Lets examine some of the more advanced item use in this game.  You've got four 
type of healing items, red, green and yellow herbs, as well as FIrst Aid 
Spray.  The green ones heal you, the red ones can be combined with the green 
ones to heal you fully and the yellow ones can be combined with the green ones 
to increase your maximum health.  First Aid Spray always heals you fully.  
COmbining items is simple, if it can be done then you just select an item, 
choose combine and then put it on top of another.  They will be combined if it 
is a possible combinatin.  Here are all the possible combinationsfor herbs:

Green + Green = Heals twice as much as Green
Green + Green + Green = Heals fully
Green + Red = Heals to full health
Green + Yellow = Heals Green amount and increases max health
Green + Red + Yellow = Heals fully and increases max health

A new mechanic introduced in this game not seen in previous ones is the 
currency system.  As you go you'll find many Pesetas (Ptas) which is the money 
you will be using.  There are various merchants which can be found throughout 
the game and they are always willing to sell you new weapons and tune up your 
old ones.  Weapons can be tuned up as well as purchased, each of the four main 
categories.  You can also sell you weapons, items and such.  One thing you can 
sell is the treasure you find.  Treasure are special items that do not take up 
space in your menu.  To view them along with your key items press the L button 
when in your menu.  Treasure looks nice bu serves no purpose but to be sold, 
the money you can make from these is quite good especially if you complete 
them before selling.  What this means is that often you will find treasure 
that was slots in it, try combining some of the jewels that you pick up to 
make the treasure more valuable.  Remember that treasure serves no purpose but 
to be sold so don't hang onto it longer than you need to.

In case you were wondering, the merchants that you visit can be shot... and 
killed.  They won't ever appear again where you killed them, but if you go 
visit another he is perfectly good and healthy.  Try to avoid it!

| \-------o--------\                    Special Techniques                   |
(10004)      \--------------------------------------------------------o

There are a number of special actions you can perform through the game.  Many 
of them involve pressing A, the action button at appropriate times however 
there are some more advanced (and not so advanced) techniques to learn.

Reloading - This would fall under the less advanced category, to reload your 
  weapon hold the R trigger to bring it up then press the B button 
  to reload the gun.  You can also reload by firing an empty gun.
Quick Turn - The quick turn is one of the most important techniques to master 
   in this game, it will save your life more than a few times.  TO 
   perform the quick turn simply press Down + B and you will do a 
   quick 180 degree turn.  Useful for running away then flipping 
   around to shoot.
Kick - The kick is a powerful melee attack which is good for both conserving 
ammunition and hitting multiple enemies at a time.  To kick enemies 
first you must stun them by shooting them in the head, or in the leg so 
that they are either staggering or on their knees.  You can also stun 
them with a Flash Grenade.  In this stunned position run up to them and 
press A to perform a kick.  Try shooting the enemies in the castle 
portion of the game in the leg, and then try the Suplex!

o------- Item Checklist -------o  When you first get control of your 
|                              |  character, start walking down the path.  If 
| Handgun Ammo..........._____ |  you try to turn around and leave across the 
| Handgun Ammo..........._____ |  bridge, the game won't let you.  Approach 
| Green Herb............._____ |  the cabin for a quick little scene.  Before 
| Green Herb............._____ |  entering the cabin, go around the left side 
| Shotgun Shells........._____ |  and you'll find a crate sitting on a wagon.  
| Red Herb..............._____ |  Shoot the crate and pick up the contents 
| Handgun Ammo..........._____ |  using the A button when standing 
| Shotgun................_____ |  close.  Go back to the entrance and enter 
| 1000 Ptas.............._____ |  the cabin.  When you walk toward the main 
| Hand Grenade..........._____ |  room a scene will occur.  Once the scene 
| Shotgun Shells........._____ |  is over you have no choice but to fight.  
| Spinel................._____ |  Press the R2 button to bring up your 
| Handgun Ammo..........._____ |  gun, and hit A to fire.  Aim with the left 
| Pearl Pendant.........._____ |  analog stick, try for head shots by 
| Handgun Ammo..........._____ |  positioning your laser scope on his face.  
| Spinel................._____ |  Another scene occurs after the 
| Spinel................._____ |  fight.  Examine the man's body.  Head up the 
| Handgun Ammo..........._____ |  stairs to find some more 'Handgun 
| 1000 Ptas.............._____ |  Ammo (10)' on the table.  When you're ready 
| Beerstein.............._____ |  examine the window and jump through it, be
|                              |  prepared to act quickly, have your weapon
o------------------------------o  at the ready before jumping out the window.

When you land you'll be ambushed by three villagers, before you begin firing, 
navigate to a safe place with your back to a wall so that none of them are 
able to come up behind you.  As previously suggested, aim for the face and if 
they get too close, try the "Kick" attack by pressing A when prompted.  You 
should be able to find more ammo and money if you examine the bodies.  If 
you're inexperienced with the controls, you likely took some damage in these 
fights.  If your character is injured, which is easy to tell by the way he 
limps, go to your menu with the Y button and use your First Aid Spray to heal 
yourself.  You don't have an unlimited number of these however, so avoiding 
damage is always the best practice.  Run back to the bridge and stand by the 
cliff, use the "Look Down" option when you get it.  You are now left with no 
choice, but to turn around and make your way toward the village.  

As you pass through the gate there's a small shack on your left.  Inside 
you'll find a number of crates, rather than shooting them save ammo by holding 
the L button to bring out your knife and slashing them.  Take the 'Handgun 
Ammo (10),' and break open the crates to get whatever is inside.  Examine the 
typewriter, you may find yourself thinking that you will be unable to use it 
due to your lack of an ink ribbon, however those days are gone and you may 
save here as much as you like.  Further down the path, just beyond the warning 
sign on your right, is a wolf caught in a bear trap.  Examine it and free the 
animal.  A dozen metres or so down the path there are a number of panels 
attached to the trees, these are explosives and if you look closely there is a 
wire running between them.  It's quite easy to see the safe path between the 
two middle trees, however if you prefer to be extra cautious, you can shoot 
and detonate the explosives from a safe distance.  Continue forward until you 
hear someone yelling, stop moving and pull out your gun as a man is about to 
ambush you.  From this distance you should be able to dispatch him with ease.

The path reamins linear to another shack on your left.  There are crates to 
break in here too.  You'll find 'Green Herb' on the table  When you leave the 
shack you'll be attacked by another two villagers, find a safe place to attack 
from a distance.  Cross the bridge and you'll see some more villagers, however 
you are lucky and they don't attack you.  There a cabin around the corner with 
someone waiting inside, if you're careful you can actually approach the door 
and get a shot in before he sees you standing there.  Inside the cabin is 
'Handgun Ammo (10)' and two crates to break open with you knife.  Leave the 
cabin and open the gate to the village for a scene.

As you walk down the path, the option to "Look" will appear.  Zoon in using 
the C stick with your Binoculars.  Now approach the village, slowly to avoid 
being seen.  You will be able to walk in and take the path on your right 
without alerting them.  Along this path on your right is a small stone 
structure with two crates.  Now try to get back to the entrance without beind 
seen.  Just before you come into the village there is a fork.  Take the left 
path, examine the logs on your left beside the cabin to find a 'Green Herb.'  
Walk forward a bit, you still shouldn't have alerted them at this point.  
Enter through the door of the next cabin you see, the door should be facing in 
your direction.  Inside the house, smash the barrel.  Break the crates on the 
table as well.  To get the rest of the stuff you'll inevitably be seen.

Leave the house and go Northwest to near where the woman is forking some hay.  
Smash the neary crate.  Continue North and follow the path to the central area 
of town.  At the North, where you should be, on the left is a large tower with 
a ladder inside.  Climb up it and pick up the 'Shotgun Shells (10).'  Now run 
around to the East side, on a cart behind one of the houses you'll find a 'Red 
Herb,' and to the South you'll find a crate.  Now enter the house South of the 
bell tower and watch the scene.  Run to the right and push the shelf in front 
of the window.  Behind the stairs are two barrels you can break open, also 
pick up the 'Handgun Ammo (10)' on the shelf behind them.  By now they have 
probably broken through the door.  Climb the stairs and pull the 'Shotgun' off 
the wall.  There's '1000 Ptas' on the shelf upstairs, also break the cabinet 
glass and pick up the 'Hand Grenade.'  On the bed at the other end are 
'Shotgun Shells (5).'  Examine the window and choose "Knock Down" to keep 
villagers from climbing into the window.  Jump out the side window, beside the 
table onto the roof.  Follow the outer walkway around to the other side of the 
house you were just in to find a 'Spinel' on the roof.  Now your only task is 
to continue killing villagers until you've killed enough, and enough time 
passes.  Try and kill the chainsaw man, he'll drop something nice.  Watch the 
scene afterward.

Now that everything's quiet again, approach follow the past leading Northeast 
away from the village.  You can confirm these directions on your map by 
pressing the Z button.  Be sure to check the house on your right along the way 
to find 'Handgun Ammo (10)' on the table.  Proceed through the gate.

Walk toward the central area, the shed on your left has a save point in it, as 
well as a barrel you can break open.  Update:  Thanks to the contributions of 
numerous people, note that you can in fact shoot down part of the well and 
knock the object down without actually dirtying it, causing the price to go 
up.  Thanks to all who helped out.  Beside this shed is a well with a shiny 
object hanging down, shoot the object with your handgun and pick up the 
'Pearl Pendant.'  Shooting your gun will alert a couple of people to your 
presance, but they won't be much trouble to take out.  Head to the left 
(North) area over the fence.  Look behind the shed here to find a barrel.  
You'll find another barrel in the small two-doored barn.  Down at the Southern 
area just above where you came in you'll find a note on the tree.  Read the 
note to learn about Blue Medallions.  The first of these medallions is hanging 
from the tree to which the note is pinned.  Shoot it, that's 01/15.  In the 
barn North of here there's a number of barrels and a crate on the shelf.  
Climb the ladder and open the blue cupboard to find 'Handgun Ammo (10).'  Jump 
out the upper window.  Directly opposite the window is an area you can jump 
down.  Break the crate to find the rare 'Beerstein' item.  Go back up the 
ladder in that barn to reach the walkway outside the window aagin, run to the 
North end of this walkway and jump down.  Break the crate directly in front of 
you.  There's a small hut under the walkway you were just on that you can 
access from this area, go inside to find a crate.

Now for the Blue Medallions.  Look at your map and you'll see a number of blue 
dots.  These are the locations of the medallions.  Go back to the central area 
of this map and lets start.  First head to the North end, hanging from the 
tree on the right of the small shack is medallion 02/15.  Go to the South end 
and turn around to face the barn in the middle.  Hanging from the upper window 
is medallion 03/15.  From the Southern area head East and stand on the pile of 
hay in the corner.  Look up to the top of the barn to see medallion 04/15 
hanging from the roof.  Enter the barn and climb the ladder, turn around and 
face North to see 05/15 in the window.  Jump out the window and run to the 
North end of the walkway, but don't jump down.  You should be able to see the 
last two from here, the first is right beside you on the right, hanging from 
the windmill.  Be careful because it's moving, this is 06/15.  The next one 
can be seen above the Northeast gate from here, but it's hard to shoot at this 
distance so you may want to drop down and shoot it from just in front of the 
gate, that's 07/15 and the last one in this area.  

Since the Northeast gate is locked, leave through the Southeast gate.  Begin 
down the path and get ready, the instant a scene occurs position your finger 
above the A button.  When you see the icon on the screen, start pressing it as 
fast as you can.  After about fifteen seconds or so a button combination will 
appear for you to dodge, you really don't have a lot of time to push it, and 
unfortunately it's random so you just have to have a sharp eye.  Two of the 
most common ones are L+R and A+B.  When you've avoided the rock, you can 
backtrack and get revenge on the two villagers standing on the bridge if you 
wish.  You destination lies beyond the tunnel.  As you go through it, shoot 
down the gems from the roof to get two 'Spinel.'  Continue to the other end.

This area is certainly the most dangerous you've encountered so far.  Make 
note of a couple of things before going in, the cabin directly in front of you 
is home to two dynamite-throwing vilagers, this as you can imagine is very 
dangerous.  When you run forward do not stop or you will be blown to bits!  
This in itself creates a problem because there are bear traps all over the 
ground, but they're mostly situated on the right side so stay left when you 
run.  You can't open the door to the cabin, but is has a large hole in it so 
you can safely eliminate the villagers in there without fear of being 
exploded.  There's another person running around free with dynamite in his 
hand, this guy's dangerous so kill him from a distance.  Watch out because if 
he dies while holding an explosive, his corpse will also explode!  When the 
area is free of enemies, make your way into the small shack to the Northwest.  
Trip the bear traps by shooting the centre of them with your Handgun.  Be 
careful not to walk across the explosive trap in this shack, break open the 
crates to get the items inside.  Head West and go around to the right side of 
the house, break open the crate at the base of the tree.  Once you've done 
this it's time to enter the house itself.  Kick it three times to open.

There's 'Handgun Ammo (10)' on the table here and '1000 Ptas' in the cabinet.  
Be sure to save your game using the typewriter.  In the next hall, stand back 
as far as you can and shoot the explosives from a distance.  The same applies 
for the next room.  Pick up the '1000 Ptas' from the table and get the 'Green 
Herb' from the cabinet.  The shelf on the North wall can be pushed out of the 
way to reveal a door to another room.  Approach the large cabinet, which is 
the source of all this pounding, and examine it for a scene.

| Handgun Ammo..........._____ |  Before leaving the house there's a shelf

| 1000 Ptas.............._____ |  it.  Leave and head around behind the house 
| Emblem (Left Half)....._____ |  for a quick scene.  This is your first shop, 
| Elegant Mask..........._____ |  you can purchase new weapons/items, as well 
| Brass Watch............_____ |  as improve old ones.  At this point there's 
| 1000 Ptas.............._____ |  lots of good stuff, and it's very doubtful 
| Insignia Key..........._____ |  you can afford it all.  Personally I enjoy 
|                              |  using sniper rifles, so I picked up the 
o------------------------------o  Rifle along with the scope.  Make your 
                        descision, choose something you like.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Just beyond the merchant around the corner you'll find some barrels to smash.  
Now leave through the main gate.  There are quite a few enemies in this area, 
I recommend sniping them if you bought the rifle, until you run out of ammo 
and then switching to the Shotgun, you should be able to do this and keep your 
damage to a bare minumum.  You'll make lots of money here as well, so a return 
trip to the merchant may also be a good idea.  When you're in the clear, take 
the path down the stairs.  Take the left path and enter the house, pick up the 
'Shotgun Shells (5)' from the shelf.  In the next room you'll find 'Handgun 
Ammo (10)' on one of the boxes.  Ascend the ladder to the roof, there's a very 
nice treasure chest here containing 'Emblem (Right Half).'  Follow the walkway 
to a barrel you can smash, then jump down.  There's red drums will explode if 
you shoot them, so stand back if you do.  Follow the path North (according to 
your map remember) and go behind the house to find a barrel.  Proceed up the 
hill, there are another couple barrels at the top, but watch out for the 
villagers above because some of them are wielding dynamite.  Go into the shack  
in front of you and open the locker to find '1000 Ptas' then climb the ladder 
outside to reach the top of it.  Another ladder here will take you to the top, 
but you'll only find a barrel.  Return to the ground again.

Cross over the bridge to the South.  Follow the path to higher ground where 
you'll find two barrels and another chest containing 'Emblem (Left Half).'  
Jump off the platform on the opposite side of the treasure box and examine the 
gate.  It will bring you to a key items menu, select one of the two emblem 
halves and choose combine.  Combine it with the other half then use the full 
emblem to unlock the door.  Follow the linear path, just before you reach the 
metal door check out the enclosed area on your left to find a couple of 
barrels you can break.  Head through the large door, break the barrel in the 
upper left door and continue.  In the next hallway there are a number of 
enemies so be careful.  You may notice they're getting smarter, if they've got 
a laser sight on their face for more than a couple of second they'll try to 
move out of the way.  Keep this is mind and shoot the instant you get the 
chance.  Kill the enemies and run to the end of the hall, break the barrel and 
jump through the window.  Now this part is dangerous, I recommend jumping 
right back through the window again.  Pull out your Handgun and eliminate the 
villagers through the window.  You won't be able to get the dynamite throwing 
ones however, so jump back and pull out your Rifle to snipe them.  If you 
approach the large container you have the option of crouching and using it for 
cover.  Take cover and then pop up when you get the chance.  You may want to 
try grenades or some alternate weapons here.  When you continue forward do NOT 
jump over the potato sacks, shoot the traps and go around because there are 
traps waiting to clamp you on the other side.  Now head through the door.

In this room you'll want to equip your Shotgun.  To get that shiny object 
you've probably had your eye on, use your Shotgun to blast those wooden boards 
out of the window.  Examine the object to receive 'Elegant Mask.'  There's a 
couple of barrels in the water room of course.  Take the only door you haven't 
been through yet.  Navigate the hallway until you reach a couple of ladders.  
If you're low on health, or just want some backup healing, you can jump down 
below and shoot some fish.  They're not dangerous, however the underwater bear 
traps are.  Go back up and climb the second ladder.

Update:  Thanks to the contributions of numerous people, note that you can in 
fact shoot down part of the well and knock the object down without actually 
dirtying it, causing the price to go up.  Thanks to all who helped out.  

To the left of the well you just jumped out of, is a shiny hanging object.  
Shoot it and pick it up to receive the 'Brass Pocket Watch.'  There's a 
barrel and a crate in the cabin just beside this as well.  Take aim and fire 
at the dynamite trap on the tree, before following the path any further, and 
just to when you thought you were clever, a bear trap is waiting as well right 
below the explosive trap.  Head up into the building and examine the door.
__   __
\ \_/ /  You'll need to rotate the object to unlock this door.  It's not too
|     hard to do, on the left is the approximate shape you need to make in
/ \    order to get it.  Once you're inside check the cabinet for '1000
|   |   Ptas' and open the box on the shelf which holds the 'Insignia Key.'
Don't miss the article found on the bed either.  When you're ready, 
and everything is out of the way then proceed through the door and watch the 
scene.  This marks the end of Chapter 1 - 2.  Be sure to save your game.

Update: Supposedly if you retrace your steps back through the house some time 
during Chapter 1 - 3, a bonus scene can be viewed.

o------- Item Checklist -------o  Examine the cabinet at the end of the hall 
|                              |  to find a 'Green Herb.'  Down the stairs

| Incendiary Grenade....._____ |  If you open the oven in the kitchen there's

| Elegant Headdress......_____ |  check out the washroom as well, beside the 
| Handgun Ammo..........._____ |  stairs but all you'll find is a crazy

| Hand Grenade..........._____ |  crate you can break in the first shack on 
| Incendiary Grenade....._____ |  your left.  There's even more enemies

| Gold Bangle w/ Pearls.._____ |  There's quite a few more villagers to fight 
| Handgun Ammo..........._____ |  in this area.  Once they're eliminated and 
| Yellow Herb............_____ |  the town quits down a bit there's something 
|                              |  you can do.  To get the rare treasure 'Red 
o------------------------------o  Catseye' take the Northeast path back to the 
                        area where the dynamite villagers were.  Up 
in the tree near the house you'll see a large white object, shoot it down to 
obtain the Red Catseye.  Back in the main village examine the door with the 
large symbol on it, where all the villagers went originally and use the 
Insignia Key when it brings up your inventory to gain access to the building.

Break the crate, and pick up the 'Handgun Ammo (10)' off the desk.  There's a 
save point on the table here as well.  Go through the door and shoot the 
light, but stand back!  When the flames go out pick up the 'Spinel.'  There's 
a trap door in the floor, open it up and jump down.  When the tunnel opens up 
you'll find two shiny objects in the room, shoot them both down to get a 
'Spinel' and 'Elegant Headdress.'  Follow the path to the South and soon 
enough you'll reach another merchant.  Pick up some new items here.

o- Merchant -----------------------------------------------------------------o
|                                                                            |

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

The only thing new that he sells is the Stock (TMP) but there's lots of old 
stuff you may not have been able to afford the first time.  Proceed further 
and climb the ladder.  This is another Blue Medallion area.  Walk along the 
path for a quick scene.  Just to be safe, before hunting for all the 
medallions kill all the enemies in this area.  Medallion 08/15 is hanging from 
a tree at the Southwest corner.  Medallion 09/15 is right in the opposite 
direction hanging from the closest tree.  Go into the shack to the West and 
get the 'Handgun Ammo (10)' off the table, as well as breaking the crates.  
Medallion 10/15 is hanging from a tree in the Northern-central area.  You can 
find 11/15 dangling from a tree to the left of the large building.  Run around 
to the back of the building to find a pedestal.  Don't do anything with it 
yet, look up and shoot medallion 12/15 hanging from the roof.  Head back and 
take the Southeast path.  You'll get a call about how you shouldn't be 
deviating from your destination, but take the path anyway.

When you come to the wooden walkway the enemies are quite easy.  Just use your 
Handgun to shoot them once in the face, then kick them off the edge.  Stand 
where you can jump over and you'll clearly see number 13/15 in front of you.  
Step into the hut and get the article off the table, watch out for the crates 
though as they may contain snakes which attack you.  As you exit the  hut you 
can see 14/15 hanging from below the path you already crossed.  Continue 
forward but before jumping across the next gap, shoot medallion 15/15 on the 
underside of the walkway.  Now go all the way back to the merchant, you can 
obtain your special gun for free now that you've shot so many.  Return to the 
greveyard and examine the door to the large building.  Once you've established 
that it's locked, go around and examine the pedestal behind the building.

You need to highlight the three symbols on the twin gravestones out front.  In 
a clockwise direction from the very top, these symbols are the first, the 
third and the fourth.  There may be a really quick way of doing this, but 
here's the following method I used that works, spin it: 3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3 
-&gt; 4 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3.  This should complete it correctly and allow you to pick 
up the 'Green Catseye' inside.  There's nothing you can do in the church right 
now so head down the scenic path on the wooden walkway that you took 
originally to get the Blue Medallions.  Head through the door at the end.

Break the barrel on the right side.  In the small shack ahead of you there's 
'Handgun Ammo (10)' and a 'Spinel' on the table.  You'll find another 
'Spinel' on the cart to the left of the shack.  Along the lower wall there's a 
bunch of tiny little huts, most are empty but the last one contains 'Handgun 
Ammo (10).'  Just before you leave the area there's a small staircase leading 
to a door.  Take that door.  Jump down and grab the 'Handgun Ammo (10)' off 
the boxes.  You'll find a save point to the Southwest as well.  Beside this is 
the merchant again, but he doesn't have any new things to sell.  The only 
other thing you'll find here is a barrel.  Climb the ladder again and leave 
the area through the mteal doors, take the gate now which leads East.

In the shack on your right there's 'Handgun Ammo (10' and a barrel to break.  
Walk forward and get ready to tap the A button again, it's the same idea as 
the last sprinting scene.  As you proceed further you'll come to an above-
water area with some enemies occupying it.  For the first guy what I like to 
do is shoot him in the face with the Hangun, then run up and kick him.  If you 
aim it right he'll fly into the dynamite trap and explode.  Shoot any 
subsequent villagers that come, then drop down the left side and turn around 
to find a 'Hand Grenade' on the ground.  Climb back up and walk across the 
main walkway again.  There are quite a few dynamite traps in this area, 
however you will find that it's quite easy to lead villagers to run right into 
them if they're in the water.  Most of the routes leading to the ramps are 
trapped.  Enter the small hut on the left of the central platform and break 
the barrel.  From here just make your way across this swamp, be careful and 
watch your back.  A number of villagers will run in from the area you started 
from and you mind find yourself ambushed from behind.  Along the walkway near 
one of the Eastern corners there's a 'Incendiary Grenade.'  Look up into the 
nearest tree and shoot down the nest, it'll drop an item.  If you go around 
and pick it up you'll get the 'Antique Pipe.'

Continue Northeast and into the shack back on land to find 'Handgun Ammo 
(10)' and a crate which probably has a snake in it.  Follow the path up to the 
gate and head through.  When you come to a fork stick with the direction you 
were already going and watch the scene at the top.  Grab the 'Red Herb' 
growing at the bottom of the tree beside you, then go back down the path and 
make a left at the fork.  On your way along before you reach the first shack 
on the right, look up into the tree and shoot down the nest.  There's a 'Gold 
Bangle w/ Pearls' inside.  Enter the shack and pick up the 'Handgun Ammo 
(10),' then beak the crate.  This crate should contain a new 'Yellow Herb.'  
If you combine this with your Green Herb your maximum HP will go up.  Keep 
following the path to another cabin where you'll find a 'Green Herb,' a 
barrel, and a save point.  Be sure to save here.  Make your way up to thedock 
and get on the little motorboat.  It's quite easy to drive, just move your 
analog stick around.  You're trying to make your way to the Southeast corner, 
as you approach it you'll automatically trigger a scene.

|                                                                            |
| If you've been disappointed in the lack of boss fights thus far you're     |
| about to see this game redeem itself far beyond anything you could         |
| imagine.  The entire thing takes place with you being dragged about by     |
| this huge monster all over the lake.  While you don't have a lot of        |
| control over your forward momentum, you do have control of your direction  |
| and you'll need to use it.  As the boss drags you throughout the lake it   |
| will knock huge piles of debris in your path which you must manouvre       |
| around.  Use the analog stick to move left and right to avoid this huge    |
| piles.  Soon afer this it will descend into the water and stop pulling     |
| you.  This is your cue to drive your boat hard to the side, either left or |
| right because it is going to burst out of the water and if you haven't     |
| changed directions you'll be aimed directly into his mouth.  This brings   |
| up the other things, which is that in the event you are knocked off of     |
| your boat, you won't die but you'll take a hefty amount of damage and have |
| to pound the A button in order to swim back to your boat and avoid being   |
| swallowed by the huge creature.  This pattern will continue for basically  |
| the entire fight except for one contingency which I will get to in a       |
| moment.  Obviously the next most important thing after staying alive is    |
| defeating the boss.  Your normal weapons are useless however the boat is   |
| heavily loaded with an infinite number of harpoons.  You'll need to use    |
| these in order to kill the boss.  Hold the R trigger and similar to most   |
| weapons a crosshair will come up which you can aim and throw.  This        |
| is how you will damage the boss, you must aim and attack while also        |
| dodging of course.  The one contingency I mentioned is that at certain     |
| points you will come to a dead stop and be automatically put in the attack |
| position.  You must determine where the boss is coming from, and aim a     |
| harpoon down his throat and he accelerates toward you to stop him from     |
| ramming your boat.  The boss gives adequate preparation time and the game  |
| gives you a handy little red arrow telling you which direction to look     |
| so it shouldn't be too hard.  Continue this strategy until the boss is hit |
| by a fatal blow.  When this happens there's a quick scene and you must     |
| rapidly tap a button to untangle the rope, but nothing you can't handle.   |
|                                                                            |

| Handgun Ammo..........._____ |  Northeast edge.  When you're inside break 
| Amber Ring............._____ |  the barrel on the left and push the box.  
| Round Insignia........._____ |  This will give you access to two more 
| 15,000 Ptas............_____ |  barrels and a ladder.  Climb the ladder and 
| Red Herb..............._____ |  push the two boxes here, it'll make a thin 
| Yellow Herb............_____ |  path for you to reach another three barrels, 
| Handgun Ammo..........._____ |  one of which holds the 'Green Gem.'  Jump 
| TMP Ammo..............._____ |  down the ladder in the middle and you'll 
| Spinel................._____ |  land inside the shop where you can get 
| Green Herb............._____ |  'Rifle Ammo (10).'  Talk to the merchant and 
| 1000 Ptas.............._____ |  make some purchases even though he has 
| Spinel................._____ |  nothing new.  Return to the front of the 
| Shotgun Shells........._____ |  shop and go around the right side to find 
| 1000 Ptas.............._____ |  two barrels, then shoot the torch above them 
| 3000 Ptas.............._____ |  which drops a 'Spinel.'  Return now to the 
|                              |  cabin where the chapter began and walk in 
o------------------------------o  the opposite direction toward the gate.

Follow the path and go through the gate.  You'll encounter a new type of enemy 
here, make sure to keep your distance as most of your weaker weapons won't 
daunt him enough to prevent him from whipping you at close range.  Once 
they're dead go up the stairs and jump across the raging river, then down a 
little and back across again.  Use the rope to climb down into the town.  If 
you look up after you land you'll see a shiny object of the cliff, shoot it 
and pick it up to receive a 'Spinel.'  Go up the ladder beside the fire but 
watch out for the villager at the top.  Break the barrel and grab the 'Handgun 
Ammo (10)' off the railing.  Head to the bottom of town and look across the 
water.  You'll see a crate hanging and no way to get across.  Shoot the chain 
and the box will drop, giving you the ability to jump over.  Run West toward 
the waterfall and look up between the two torches to see a shiny object.  
Shoot it down and pick it up to receive the 'Amber Ring.'  If you look on your 
left you'll see a crate hanging from a chain on a moving crane, shoot this 
chain and go back down.  Jump onto the box and pull out your Rifle, if you 
don't have the Rifle you'll need to go back up and climb the ladder.  Use 
whatever means necessary to shoot the chain holding the higher crate to the 
Northwest.  This will give you two crates beside each other and enough room to 
jump across to the other side.  Ascend the ladder leading to the roof of the 
house and operate the large switch to stop the flow of the water.

Jump back across to the middle platform, but watch out because this will 
trigger an attack from a bunch of enemies.  Fend them off as best you can as 
you make your way toward the now-dry waterfall.  At the end of the cave 
examine the large emblem on the wall to receive the 'Round Insignia.'  Take 
the shortcut and break open the barrels before stepping onto the boat.  You 
should recognize this place.  Ahead of you on your left is the merchant and a 
save point.  Ascend the ladder and take a couple of steps West for a scene.

o- Boss (El Gigante) --------------------------------------------------------o
|                                                                            |
| This giant hulking monster will be your opponent, he certainly lives up    |
| to his name.  There are quite a few attacks this boss has so it's hard to  |
| predict them, as he follows no particular pattern.  Basically he has two   |
| primary attacks which are grabbing you and kicking you.  Both are close    |
| range attacks so he won't do them if you're on the other side of the area. |
| For long range attacks he can interact with the environment, this involves |
| picking up large rocks or even trees.  The rocks can be avoided by running |
| in one direction, the tree can be avoided by a quick tap of L + R when     |
| prompted.  After not too much time has passed, the wolf that you saved at  |
| the beginning of the game will appear and start to run around the field,   |
| distracting the boss.  The wolf cannot die so this is your opportunity     |
| to attack while he isn't chasing you.  Pull out your most powerful weapon  |
| and begin shooting at him.  Don't put too much emphasis on shooting him in |
| the head since it really doesn't make much difference.  In fact this isn't |
| how you damage the boss at all.  After he has been shot enough times he'll |
| crouch down in pain and the true enemy will expose itself, the parasite in |
| his back.  Refrain from shooting this thing as well and approach the boss  |
| from behind, you'll get the option to climb up.  When you do you'll either |
| have to tap A or B as fast as possible to start cutting the monster.  Soon |
| he will stand up and you can repeat the process over again.  The tentacle  |
| takes about fifteen cuts to die, so it should take about two tries or      |
| maybe three if you're a bit slower.  One more thing to note about this     |
| battle is that the boss will only interact with the environment if you     |
| lead him to it.  If you're not good at dodging trees then don't ever run   |
| near one.  There are some exceptions of course but this is the general     |
| idea.  When he's bounding in your direction try to avoid running between   |
| his legs since it will usually just result in being kicked, go around to   |
| one side and you should be able to avoid both of his close range attacks.  |
| Also try to stay away from the huts at the lower part of the field,        |
| if they remain in tact you can find items in them after the fight.         |
| Also I figured it was a given but I've received a number of emails about   |
| so I guess people would like to know.  The Rocket Launcher which kills     |
| virtually every enemy in the game in a single hit makes quick work of the  |
| El Gigante as well, saves you a lot of parasite-chopping time.             |
|                                                                            |

Examine the boss' body to receive '15,000 Ptas.'  If you didn't already during 
the fight grab the 'Red Herb' and 'Yellow Herb' as well as the 'Handgun Ammo 
(10)' from near the cart.  In the first hut you can get 'TMP Ammo (50),' 
'Spinel,' and 'Green Herb.'  In the second there's '1000 Ptas' and 'Handgun 
Ammo (10).'  Finally in the last one you'll find 'Spinel,' 'Shotgun Shells 
(10),' and '1000 Ptas.'  A nice reward for keeping the huts up.  Continue your 
trek West and go through the door.  Run across the walkway, but stop in the 
shack because the crates have respawned.  Before going up the hill that leads 
to the church prepare yourself very carefully.  Awaiting you at the top are 
some extremely dangerous wolf enemies, and if you're caught off guard there's 
almost no way to escape.  The crates have respawned as well in the shack West 
of here.  When you're ready go up to the church and examine the door, you'll 
be brought to your inventory.  Select the Round Insignia and use it to enter.

Break the barrel on the right side of the church, then get the '3000 Ptas' 
from the cabinet behind the altar.  Follow the East hall to a ladder you can 
climb.  As you go along the path, check your right side for the option to 
jump.  When you do you'll land on the chandelier.  Keep tapping A as fast as 
possible so that when the option to jump again appears, you'll make it across.  
Head left and break open the two barrels, then examine the control panel.

This puzzle is actually quite easy.  All you have to do is rotate each colour 
so that they match the outline of the colour on the centre circle.  To do this 
is quite simple, you need to turn the red one two times, the green one three 
times and the blue one only once.  Then select the option "Combine" from the 
possible choices and the gates will unlock.  Follow the hall around and enter 
the door to trigger a scene.  After the scene break all the barrels in the 
room and exit.  Jump down the ladder and press A when you hit the ground to 
catch Ashley.  Head forward to trigger another scene.

Continue through the cave and climb up the ladder.  Save your game here and 
head into town.  There are quite a few enemies here.  Your destination is 
somewhere you've been before, the other section of the village to the 
Northeast.  Don't tell Ashley to wait, make sure she's with you at all times 
because the enemies will come from all directions and you won't be able to 
protect her from afar.  Another important thing to watch out for is bear 
traps.  If they catch her you have to help her yourself, she can't do it 
alone.  Head through the door to the next area.  Approach the bin and tell 
Ashley to hide inside.  Make your rounds of this place and wipe out all the 
bad guys, be careful of going for headshots here as it may cause the parasite 
to spring out from the villagers necks making them much more dangerous.  If 
this happens equip a high powered gun.  Grab the note inside the shack to the 
left of the entrance, and save here as well.  There are a number of items to 
pick up in this area, not just crates and barrels but also more items.  
They're in pretty much the same places they were before so I won't go into 
detail, but the non-random stuff pretty much includes 'Handgun Ammo (10),' 
'Handgun Ammo (10),' 'Green Herb,' and two boxes of '1000 Ptas.'  Go up the 
ladder in the barn, being careful of bear traps, and go along the walkway to 
the Northeast gate.  As you approach it you'll have the option of 
piggybacking.  Use this option to get through the gate.

Walk forward and you'll meet the merchant again.  Start crossing the bridge 
and there's a quick scene.  Across the bridge is another scene and something 
is coming which is harder than any boss fight you have faced so far.  This is 
a complete barrage of villagers attacking a little house which you are held up 
in.  Surviving will become very difficult here so listen closely.  Your weapon 
of choice is the Shotgun, with this you can take out both multiple enemies at 
a time as well as kill the parasite enemies fairly easy if you're close 
enough.  Hopefully you've got it upgraded a bit.  Your first priority should 
be to block the three windows using the three conveniently placed bookcases.  
After this make sure all your guns are fully reloaded, and pick up the 'Red 
Herb,' 'Yellow Herb,' and 'Shotgun Shells' from around the room.  Soon enough 
some enemies are going to break through one of the shelves, run up to them and 
fire you Shotgun around cranial height to knock most of them back.  If you 
ever get the chance to kick make sure you take advantage of it.  Luis will 
certainly holld his own weight, he's a great shot and he'll toss out items to 
you.  He's even next to invincible as well so you don't have to cover him too 
much but it's still a good idea.  Once enough villagers are dead he'll call 
for you to go upstairs.  This makes things easier temporarily until they start 
coming in through the windows.  Knock down the ladders and keep control of the 
stairs.  Tossing grenades is a great way to show them whose boss, especially 
when they're all congregated on the staircase.  Keep shooting and shooting and 
soon enough you'll be interrupted by a scene, and the end of the chapter.
